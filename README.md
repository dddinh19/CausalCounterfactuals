This project builds upon the DiCE explanation framework originally developed by Microsoft Corporation. The original code can be found at [DiCE Repository](https://github.com/interpretml/DiCE). It is referenced in the paper by Mothilal, R.K., et al. titled "Explaining machine learning classifiers through diverse counterfactual explanations," presented at the 2020 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency.

The modifications made to the original code are clearly presented in our paper entitled "Enhancing Counterfactual Explanations with Causal Inference: Integrating DirectLiNGAM and Variational Autoencoders for Constraint-Aware Generation." These changes are detailed to provide clarity on how the enhancements align with the study's goals and methodologies. The paper discusses the integration of causal inference techniques into the counterfactual explanation process, offering a deeper insight into the generation mechanism and its implications.
